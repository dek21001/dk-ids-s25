# What is Web Scraping?
- Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites.
- Automates data gathering for analysis, research, and business intelligence.


# How Web Scraping Works
1. Send an HTTP request to a website.
2. Retrieve the HTML content of the page.
3. Parse and extract specific data.
4. Store the extracted data for further use.


# Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, R
- **Python Libraries:** BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium
- **APIs:** When available, APIs provide structured data.


# Web Scraping vs. APIs
- **Web Scraping:** Extracts unstructured data from web pages.
- **APIs:** Provide structured data in a predefined format.
- Scraping is useful when APIs are unavailable.
- APIs are more stable and reliable.


# Challenges of Web Scraping
- **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Captchas, IP blocking.
- **Website Structure Changes:** HTML structures evolve.
- **Data Cleaning:** Extracted data often needs formatting.


# Web Scraping with Python (Example)
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
```


# Best Practices
- Use headers and user-agents to mimic real users.
- Implement delays to avoid being blocked.
- Use proxy servers or rotating IPs for large-scale scraping.
- Store data efficiently in databases or structured files (CSV, JSON).


# Alternatives to Web Scraping
- Public APIs
- Data repositories (e.g., Kaggle)
- Manual data extraction (if feasible)


# Conclusion
- Web scraping is a powerful tool for data extraction.
- Choose the right tools based on your needs.
- Always scrape responsibly and ethically.
- Stay updated with legal and technical changes.
