        "# What is Web Scraping?\n",
        "- Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites.\n",
        "- Automates data gathering for analysis, research, and business intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# How Web Scraping Works\n",
        "1. Send an HTTP request to a website.\n",
        "2. Retrieve the HTML content of the page.\n",
        "3. Parse and extract specific data.\n",
        "4. Store the extracted data for further use.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Tools and Technologies\n",
        "- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, R\n",
        "- **Python Libraries:** BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium\n",
        "- **JavaScript Libraries:** Puppeteer, Cheerio\n",
        "- **APIs:** When available, APIs provide structured data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Web Scraping vs. APIs\n",
        "- **Web Scraping:** Extracts unstructured data from web pages.\n",
        "- **APIs:** Provide structured data in a predefined format.\n",
        "- Scraping is useful when APIs are unavailable.\n",
        "- APIs are more stable and reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Ethical and Legal Considerations\n",
        "- Always check a websiteâ€™s `robots.txt` file.\n",
        "- Avoid scraping personal or sensitive data.\n",
        "- Respect rate limits and website terms of service.\n",
        "- Be mindful of copyright and data privacy laws.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Challenges of Web Scraping\n",
        "- **Dynamic Content:** JavaScript-driven pages.\n",
        "- **Anti-Scraping Measures:** Captchas, IP blocking.\n",
        "- **Website Structure Changes:** HTML structures evolve.\n",
        "- **Data Cleaning:** Extracted data often needs formatting.\n",
